## 🔍 Server Logs

You'll see in your server console:

```bash
# 1st Attempt
[ScreenshotDetectionService] Screenshot Attempt - User: abc123, Method: Mac screenshot shortcut: Cmd+Shift+3, IP: 192.168.1.1, Time: 2024-01-01...

# 2nd Attempt
[ScreenshotDetectionService] Screenshot Attempt - User: abc123...
[ScreenshotDetectionService] 📧 Notifying admins: User abc123 has 2 screenshot violations

# 3rd Attempt
[ScreenshotDetectionService] Screenshot Attempt - User: abc123...
[ScreenshotDetectionService] 🚫 SUSPENDING USER ACCOUNT: abc123 - Third screenshot violation detected
[ScreenshotDetectionService] 🚨 URGENT: Notifying admins of account suspension - User abc123
```

---

## 👨‍💼 Admin Notifications

### On 2nd Violation:
```
📧 Email subject: "Security Alert: Screenshot Violation - User abc123"
🔔 In-app: "Screenshot Violation Detected" (High priority)
📊 Dashboard: High priority alert
```

### On 3rd Violation (Suspension):
```
📧 Email subject: "🚫 URGENT: Account Suspended - Copyright Violation"
   Priority: HIGH
🔔 In-app: "Account Suspended" (Critical, requires action)
📜 Audit log: Suspension event logged
```

### To Enable Email Notifications:

**File:** `/apps/server/src/integrations/security/screenshot-detection.service.ts`

Uncomment TODO sections in:
- Lines ~180-220: `notifyAdminsOfViolation()`
- Lines ~230-280: `notifyAdminsOfSuspension()`

---

## 🗄️ Database Integration (Optional)

### Current State:
- ✅ In-memory storage (works for testing)
- ✅ Tracks attempts during server runtime
- ⚠️  Resets on server restart

### To Enable Persistence:

1. **Create database table** (see `SCREENSHOT_DETECTION_GUIDE.md` for SQL schema)

2. **Uncomment TODOs in service** (`screenshot-detection.service.ts`):
   - `logScreenshotAttempt()` - Line ~70
   - `getUserStatus()` - Line ~105
   - `suspendUserAccount()` - Line ~145

3. **Add to your database models**

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Warning Thresholds

**Current:** 1 = warning, 2 = final, 3 = suspend

**To change to:** 1-2 = warning, 3 = final, 4 = suspend

**File:** `/apps/server/src/integrations/security/screenshot-detection.service.ts` (Line 70)

```typescript
if (userStatus.attemptCount <= 2) {
  userStatus.status = 'warning';
} else if (userStatus.attemptCount === 3) {
  userStatus.status = 'final_warning';
  await this.notifyAdminsOfViolation(...);
} else if (userStatus.attemptCount >= 4) {
  userStatus.status = 'suspended';
  // ...
}
```

---

### Customize Warning Messages

**File:** `/apps/client/src/components/ScreenshotDetection.tsx` (Lines 46-130)

```typescript
if (count === 1) {
  message = {
    title: 'Your Custom Title',
    message: `Your custom message here...`,
    severity: 'warning' as const,
  };
}
```

---

### Adjust Detection Sensitivity

**File:** `/apps/client/src/components/ScreenshotDetection.tsx`

```typescript
// Make less sensitive (fewer false positives):

// Visibility changes (line 115)
if (visibilityChangeCount.current >= 5) {  // Was 3, now 5

// Blur events (line 130)
if ((window as any)._blurCount >= 3) {  // Was 2, now 3
```

---

### Disable Specific Detection Methods

**File:** `/apps/client/src/components/ScreenshotDetection.tsx` (Lines 200-210)

```typescript
// Comment out methods you don't want:
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown, true);  // Keep this
// document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);  // Disabled
// window.addEventListener('blur', handleBlur);  // Disabled
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### Cannot Detect:
- ❌ Third-party apps (Snagit, Lightshot, etc.)
- ❌ Phone cameras taking photos of screen
- ❌ Screen recording software
- ❌ Virtual machine host screenshots
- ❌ Hardware screenshot devices

### May Have False Positives:
- ⚠️  User frequently switching apps (work pattern)
- ⚠️  Using alt-tab for multitasking
- ⚠️  Multiple monitor setups
- ⚠️  Browser tab management

**Recommendation:**
- Start with lenient thresholds
- Monitor false positive rate
- Adjust based on user feedback
- Provide clear appeal process
