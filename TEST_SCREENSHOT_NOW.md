# 🚀 Test Screenshot Detection NOW

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: How Mac Screenshot Detection Works**

### **You CANNOT prevent screenshots on macOS**
- Cmd+Shift+3/4/5 work at **OS level**
- Browser cannot intercept these
- Screenshot **will be taken**

### **What We CAN Do:**
- ✅ Detect it **immediately after** (within 500ms)
- ✅ Show warning modal
- ✅ Log to backend
- ✅ Auto-suspend after 3 attempts

**This is the best any web app can do!**

---

## 🧪 **Test It RIGHT NOW**

### 1. Wait for Build
Watch your terminal for:
```
✓ built in XXXms
```

### 2. Hard Refresh Browser
```
Cmd + Shift + R
```

### 3. Open Browser Console
```
F12 or Cmd + Option + I
```

### 4. Verify You're a Member
In console, run:
```javascript
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user') || '{}')?.user?.role
```
Must show: `"member"`

If shows `"admin"` or `"owner"` → Detection won't work (admins exempt)

### 5. Navigate to Any Document Page

### 6. Check Console Logs
You should see:
```
[ScreenshotDetection] Attaching event listeners for member user
[ScreenshotDetection] Platform: MacIntel
[ScreenshotDetection] Is Mac: true
```

If you DON'T see these → Component not loaded (check user role)

### 7. Take Screenshot
```
Press: Cmd + Shift + 3
```

**What happens:**
1. Screenshot is taken (you hear the click)
2. **500ms later** → Warning modal appears ✅
3. Console shows: `[ScreenshotDetection] Page visibility changed - hidden`

### 8. Test Escalation
```
Attempt 1: Cmd+Shift+3 → Orange warning
Attempt 2: Cmd+Shift+3 → Red final warning
Attempt 3: Cmd+Shift+3 → Gray suspension modal
```

---

## ✅ **Expected Results**

### You Should See:

**1st Screenshot:**
```
⚠️ Screenshot Detected
This is a friendly reminder that screenshots are not allowed.
This action is being logged and reported to admins.
Further attempts will escalate and get your account suspended.
```

**2nd Screenshot:**
```
⚠️ Second Screenshot Detected
This is your FINAL WARNING.
Admins have been notified.
Further attempt will get your account suspended with no right to appeal.
No refund will be given.
```

**3rd Screenshot:**
```
🚫 Account Suspended
Access revoked immediately.
```

## 🐛 **Not Working? Debug:**

### Debug Step 1: Check User Role
```javascript
// In console:
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user') || '{}');
console.log('Role:', user?.user?.role);
console.log('Is member:', user?.user?.role === 'member');
```

**If NOT member** → Detection is disabled by design (admins need unrestricted access)

### Debug Step 2: Check Component Loaded
```javascript
// In console (before taking screenshot):
console.log('Component exists:', !!document.body.innerHTML.includes('ScreenshotDetection'));
```

### Debug Step 3: Monitor Visibility
```javascript
// In console:
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
  console.log('👁️ Visibility changed! Hidden:', document.hidden);
});
// Then take screenshot - should see this log
```

### Debug Step 4: Check Server Logs
In your terminal where dev server is running:
```
[ScreenshotDetectionService] Screenshot Attempt - User: xxx...
```

## 🎯 **How Detection Works**

```
User presses Cmd+Shift+3
        ↓
macOS takes screenshot (*click*)
        ↓
Browser loses focus briefly
        ↓
visibilitychange event fires
        ↓
Our code detects it (500ms delay)
        ↓
Warning modal appears ✅
        ↓
Logged to backend ✅
        ↓
Admins notified (2nd+ attempt) ✅
```

---

## 📊 **Server Logs**

Check terminal for:
```bash
[ScreenshotDetectionService] Screenshot Attempt - User: abc123, Method: Screenshot detected via page visibility change, IP: 192.168.1.1, Time: ...

[ScreenshotDetectionService] 📧 Notifying admins: User abc123 has 2 screenshot violations

[ScreenshotDetectionService] 🚫 SUSPENDING USER ACCOUNT: abc123 - Third screenshot violation detected
```

---

## 🔧 **Still Not Working?**

### Try Alternative Detection:

Take screenshot, then immediately:
1. Click another app
2. Click back to browser
3. Repeat quickly

This triggers blur detection as fallback.
