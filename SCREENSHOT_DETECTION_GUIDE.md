## 🗄️ Database Integration (Optional)

### Recommended Schema:

```sql
-- Screenshot attempts log
CREATE TABLE screenshot_attempts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  workspace_id UUID REFERENCES workspaces(id),
  method VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  details TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  ip_address INET,
  attempt_number INTEGER,
  status VARCHAR(50),
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Update users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN screenshot_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN account_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'good_standing';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_suspended BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN suspension_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN suspended_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_screenshot_attempts_user ON screenshot_attempts(user_id, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_screenshot_attempts_workspace ON screenshot_attempts(workspace_id, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_suspended ON users(is_suspended) WHERE is_suspended = TRUE;
```

### To Enable Database Persistence:

**File:** `/apps/server/src/integrations/security/screenshot-detection.service.ts`

Uncomment the `TODO` sections in:
- `logScreenshotAttempt()` - Lines ~70-90
- `getUserStatus()` - Lines ~105-120
- `suspendUserAccount()` - Lines ~145-165
- `notifyAdminsOfViolation()` - Lines ~180-220
- `notifyAdminsOfSuspension()` - Lines ~230-280

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Warning Thresholds

**File:** `/apps/server/src/integrations/security/screenshot-detection.service.ts`

```typescript
// Current: 1 = warning, 2 = final, 3 = suspend
// Change to: 1 = warning, 2 = warning, 3 = final, 4 = suspend

if (userStatus.attemptCount <= 2) {
  userStatus.status = 'warning';
} else if (userStatus.attemptCount === 3) {
  userStatus.status = 'final_warning';
  await this.notifyAdminsOfViolation(userId, userStatus.attemptCount, attempt);
} else if (userStatus.attemptCount >= 4) {
  userStatus.status = 'suspended';
  // ...
}
```

---

### Customize Warning Messages

**File:** `/apps/client/src/components/ScreenshotDetection.tsx`

```typescript
// Lines 46-130
// Modify the message object for each attempt count

if (count === 1) {
  message = {
    title: 'Your Custom Title',
    message: `Your custom message here`,
    severity: 'warning' as const,
  };
}
```

---

### Adjust Detection Sensitivity

**File:** `/apps/client/src/components/ScreenshotDetection.tsx`

```typescript
// Visibility changes threshold (line 115)
if (visibilityChangeCount.current >= 5) {  // Increase from 3 to 5
  showScreenshotWarning('Suspicious activity: Multiple visibility changes');
}

// Blur events threshold (line 130)
if ((window as any)._blurCount >= 3) {  // Increase from 2 to 3
  showScreenshotWarning('Suspicious activity: Multiple window focus changes');
}
```

---

### Disable Specific Detection Methods

**File:** `/apps/client/src/components/ScreenshotDetection.tsx`

```typescript
// Comment out unwanted detection methods in useEffect (lines 200-210)

// document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);  // Disabled
// window.addEventListener('blur', handleBlur);  // Disabled
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What This CANNOT Detect:
- ❌ **Third-party apps** - External screenshot tools (Snagit, etc.)
- ❌ **Phone cameras** - Photos of screen
- ❌ **Screen recording** - Video capture
- ❌ **Virtual machines** - Screenshots from VM host
- ❌ **Hardware** - Monitor screenshot devices

### False Positives:
- User legitimately switching apps
- Using alt-tab frequently
- Browser tab management
- Multi-monitor setups

**Recommendation:** 
- Start with lenient thresholds
- Monitor false positive rate
- Adjust sensitivity based on feedback
